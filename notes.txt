Notes:

- Exmaples are good.
- Can we surface examples relative to the repo code. (After analyzing the code)
  - These would give the user something to go off of
  - Are there predetermined actions users are often looking for.
  - Genres (Refactoring (conversions, new dependencies, updating dependencies -> react 16 -> 17), linting, analyzing, asking questions, generation, alternatives)
- Conversational flow


Today:
- Conversational flow (Use chat gpt api)
- How can we analyze the code of the repo as context for the ai's suggestions.
- Improve the ux
